BRK2013 (Becske Buddhist course registration)
==========================================================

Rails 3 based event registration application with Active Admin, nested forms.
The application served 4000 people registration online and it was also used for the on site registration. There is a lot of hard coding involved and the static pages are not developed properly because of the close deadline.

This application has been discontinued. It has been upgraded to Rails 4 and it was simplified.
