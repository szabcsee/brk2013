          title: "Guru Yoga"
          title_book: "From the book The Way Things Are by Lama Ole Nydahl"
          chapter_title: "The way of identification — accomplishing the teacher’s qualities and powerfield"
          par_1: "Resting in the states of bliss and space inseparable, engendered by the meditations on buddha forms and their mantras, produces the finest of spiritual qualities. Experience shows that experiencing the ordinary on the highest level happens when a teacher’s ability to inspire and a student’s idealistic openness meet. Their union vastly increases the effectiveness of any meditation. Known as Guru Yoga or Lami Naljor, this method was singled out by the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa and given to my wife Hannah and myself as the main practice for our worldwide Diamond Way centers. Easy to approach and enabling people to recognize and learn from meaningful qualities in all of life’s situations, it is an exceedingly skillful tool for developing identification and trust."
          par_2: "Partaking in the view of a realized lama, one gains certainty that potential enlightenment is already present in everyone and can be realized. This exchange is so all encompassing and impressive that one enters a mental state of bliss and deep meaning, a so-called Pure Land. One can no longer forget it, and appearing for ever longer periods when one’s practice is without expectation, such a view will enrich every aspect of one’s way. The main object to accomplish after a Kagyu transmission is to increasingly experience that which looks through out eyes and hears through our ears and remain aware both during meditation and in daily life. For that mighty task, a teacher is indispensable and as the great lama Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche often said, “Above all one must keep the connection to the teacher who first showed one the nature of mind. Otherwise deep dissatisfaction appears and one’s development simply stalls.”"
          par_3: "From 1050 to 1950 AD, when the communist Chinese first attacked Eastern Tibet, these methods, providing direct access to mind, were passed on in Tibet in their fullness. Without interruption and as a living stream, both view and methods were transmitted from teachers to students, who then became teachers. In Europe and gradually all over the West, this transmission has continued since 1972. Therefore, in Diamond Way centers worldwide, whoever teaches represents the Karma Kagyu lineage: the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, who established the practices; his 17th incarnation, the Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje; and the root lama representing the lineage, the one students know and ultimately trust."
          par_4: "All who have confidence in mind’s limitless potential recognize their abilities in the mirror held by a skillful teacher. Already at one’s first taking of refuge, a connection is activated between the inherent insight of the students’ minds and the timeless wisdom of all buddhas. Every event can now be used for growth. Pleasant situations appear as blessings to be shared with others, while difficult experiences liberate one’s store consciousness from countless causes of later suffering. It is joyful and makes sense to use one’s experiences for the good of others and to share all blessings with them."
          par_5: "Buddhism shows how things are and only aims to bring people to maturity. This frees Buddhist teachers from any dishonest roles of installing beliefs or having to sell others illogical messages. Instead they are supposed to know and embody what they teach. Their job is to make students independent and capable by reflecting back their inherent, fearless, and joyful compassion. This is a hand-me-down process, open to the methods of modern communication and may therefore benefit countless open minds. As each generation of students become teachers and come to trust their own ability to help others, their students will develop beyond personal qualities and express them, inspiring again the next wave. Therefore the meditation of becoming inseparable from the teacher is the fastest and most useful way for those fortunate ones who can use it. Behaving like one’s teacher or the Buddha until one has acquired such qualities, lets timeless and limitless qualities grow in anyone’s mind."
          par_6: "Throughout history and up to the present, transmission lineages consist of students who realize mind’s nature with the methods and views of their schools within the blessing stream of their teacher’s awareness. This happens today, when after sufficient practice, students become knowledgeable teachers or lamas themselves and pass on this living stream. A historical example of a teacher’s importance goes back to the year 1050 AD in Tibet. At that time the hero Marpa, father of the lay Diamond Way Karma Kagyu transmission, brought Buddhism over the Himalayas to Tibet, for the second time, after its destruction under the shamanist King Langdharma in 800 AD. He trained and taught his main student Milarepa, who then had two main students: Rechungpa, the independent minded yogi with a keen sense of the goodness of women, carried on the lay transmission while Gampopa, the first monk in the lineage, created its central monastic branch."
          par_7: "One day in Northern India when Marpa was studying with Naropa, his main teacher, and deep in meditation, the Buddha Oh Diamond (Sanskrit: Hevajra, Tibetan: Kye Dorje), suddenly condensed at Marpa’s side. Big as a house, blue, transparent, and radiating like a thousand suns, Hevajra’s many hands held skull cups and he embraced his blue consort, Not-I (Sanskrit: Nairamya, Tibetan: Dagmema), in standing union. Marpa was deeply moved and Naropa, who probably looked like any other old Indian, wrinkled and burned black from the sun, asked him, “Now you see him and me. Which one will you greet first?” Marpa’s thinking is not hard to follow. He bowed to the buddha form. But Naropa laughed. “Wrong choice!” he said, “With us everything is the teacher.” Then Naropa dissolved the huge powerfield of Hevajra into rainbow light and drew it into his heart."
          par_8: "In the West and today the teacher retains such vital importance to Buddha’s Diamond Way. His blessing shows the world to be a dream that can be mastered. His or hers spontaneous and effortless activity convinces one of basic unity. One recognizes that the experiencer, the object experienced, and the act of experiencing must all be interdependent, inseparable, and parts of the same totality. As with the other means used in meditation, the formless methods of experiencing mind’s space insight and the complete tool of identification with and dissolving with buddha forms, a natural state of knowing they are aspects of one’s trusted lama arises and one realizes the Great Seal of ultimate meaning. Then it becomes less important which of the ways one uses to get to this understanding. Its highest view contains everything and is unique. It has an unshakeable foundation: the inherent buddha nature of all beings, a true way to experience a meaningful life using the finest of methods for absorption and human growth, and above all, the ultimate goal of full enlightenment. Every concept pales in comparison with such total awareness. "

          title: "Karma Pakshi the second Karmapa"
          subtitle: "1204 - 1283"
          description: "From Chilay Tsakto in Eastern Tibet, the second Karmapa, Karma Pakshi, was something of a child prodigy. By the age of six, he had taught himself to read and write. At ten, he was displaying a photographic memory for texts. On his way to Central Tibet for further education, he encountered Pomdragpa Sonam Dorje, who had been told by a vision of Dusum Khyenpa, the first Karmapa, that this boy would become the next lineage-holder. Karma Pakshi was persuaded to stay, and received the Kagyu transmission. In time, he became renowned for his powers, and had students throughout Tibet, China and Mongolia."
